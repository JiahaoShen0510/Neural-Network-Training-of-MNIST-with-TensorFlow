Apply the TensorFlow to train the neural netrowks by using the TensorFlow built-in dataset of MNIST.

The MNIST dataset totally consists 60,000 images in training part and 10,000 images in testing part. Set the batch size of 100, build three hidden layers with the activation function of Rectified Linear Unit, and the SoftMax function for the final layer. Apply the Adam optimizer and run the epochs 1o times. 

Achieve the accuracy rate of 99.15% on training set and 98.95% on validation set. 

For testing, the model achieves the 97.95% accuracy rate.
